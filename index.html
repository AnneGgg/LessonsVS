            <h2>When you get a choice</h2>
            <p>There are so many different things to try in our big wide world. Sometimes it is easier to start with something you think is achievable. With a comfort zone in education, it was easy to choose to learn something new. And with a huge lack of knowledge in technology, I am so grateful to have found an option to learn and increase my skills.</p>
            
            <div id="choices">
                <h3>Choose something that:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Excites</strong> you</li>
                    <li>You are curious about</li>
                    <li>You are ready to try</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <p>All of the skills I am learning are both challenging and exciting. Ideas have started to form that I look forward to trying. It is so hard to believe that in a few short months I went from someone who knew very little about technology, to this person who is gaining confidence in the ability to tackle different tasks.</p>

            <h2>When there is no choice</h2>
            <p>Sometimes there is no choice, and a new experience is thrust on you, if it is exciting, then it is easier to lean into the experience. If the experience is scary, with a lot of unknowns, then try your best to stay calm, pay attention, and <em>trust</em> that you will get through the experience feeling satisified with the outcome, or simply thankful that the experience is over.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Trust yourself</li>
                <li>Rely on your support people</li>
                <li>Stay calm, and add your healthy stress relievers</li>
                <li>Take it one step at a time</li>
                <li>Believe you can do it</li>
            </ol>
